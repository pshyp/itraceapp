# Welcome to My Dummy Blog

This is a placeholder blog post written in MDX. It's designed to demonstrate how you can combine Markdown with JSX.

Here's an image to make things interesting:

<img src="/images/placeholder-image.jpg" alt="A placeholder image" width="500" />

You can also include code blocks like this:
```
javascript
console.log("Hello, MDX!");
```
This is just the beginning! You can add more content, images, and even interactive components to your MDX blog posts.

Stay tuned for more exciting posts!
